Besearcher
======================

Besearcher (bot researcher) is a tool to help researchers automate and keep track of software-based experiments. It automatically monitors a git repository and performs a pre-defined command for each new commit. It is also possible to keep track of commands (running, finished or aborted) and the output they produced.
